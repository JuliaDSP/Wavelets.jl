# WAVELET CLASSES

"""
The `WaveletClass` type has subtypes `OrthoWaveletClass`,
 `BiOrthoWaveletClass`, and `ContinuousWaveletClass`

The `WT` module has for convenience constants defined named
as the class short name and optionally amended with a number
specifing the number of vanishing moments.

A class can also be explicitly constructed as e.g. `Daubechies{4}()`.

`WT.db2`, `WT.haar`, `WT.cdf97`

Construct wavelet type where `c` is a wavelet class,
`t` is the transformation type (`WT.Filter` or `WT.Lifting`),
and `boundary` is the type of boundary treatment. In the continuous case, s>0
is the number of wavelets between the octaves ``2^J`` and ``2^{J+1}``
(defaults to 8, which is most appropriate for music and other audio).
