# WAVELET CLASSES

"""
The `WaveletClass` type has subtypes `OrthoWaveletClass`,
 `BiOrthoWaveletClass`, and `ContinuousWaveletClass`

The `WT` module has for convenience constants defined named
as the class short name and optionally amended with a number
specifing the number of vanishing moments.

A class can also be explicitly constructed as e.g. `Daubechies{4}()`.

The constructor for the CFW struct. w is a type of continuous wavelet,
scalingFactor is the number of wavelets between the octaves ``2^J`` and
``2^{J+1}`` (defaults to 8, which is most appropriate for music and other
audio). As this leads to excessively many high scale wavelets, `decreasing`
gives the amount that scalingFactor decreases per octave. The default boundary
condition is `periodic`, which is implemented by appending a flipped version of
the vector at the end (to eliminate edge discontinuities). Alternatives are
`ZPBoundary`, which pads with enough zeros to get to the nearest power of 2
(here the results returned by caveats are relevant, see Torrence and Compo
'97), and `NullBoundary`, which assumes the data is inherently periodic.

`averagingLength` and `averagingType` determine how wide scale information is
accounted for. `averagingLength` gives the number of wavelet octaves that are
covered by the averaging, while averaging type determines whether it is a
window `Dirac` or a wavelet `Father`. `frameBound` gives the total norm of the
whole collection, corresponding to the upper frame bound. `normalization`
refers to which p-norm is preserved as the scale changes. `normalization==2` is
the default scaling, while `normalization==Inf` gives all the same maximum
value, thus acting more like windows.

this creates the averaging function, which covers the low frequency
information, and is emphatically not analytic. aT determines whether it has the
same form as the wavelets (`Father`), or just a bandpass `Dirac`. 
`c.averagingLength` gives the number of octaves (base 2) that are covered by
the averaging function. The width is then derived so that it matches the next
wavelet at 1σ.

For the Morlet wavelet, the distribution is just a Gaussian, so it has variance
1/s^2 and mean σ[1]*s set the variance so that the averaging function has 1σ at
the central frequency of the last scale.

For the Paul wavelets, it's a easy calculation to see that the mean of a paul
wavelet of order m is (m+1)/s, while σ=sqrt(m+1)/s. So we set the variance so
that the averaging function has 1σ at the central frequency of the last scale.

the derivative of a Gaussian (Dog) has a pretty nasty form for the mean and
variance; eventually, if you set σ_{averaging}=⟨ω⟩_{highest scale wavelet}, you
will get the scale of the averaging function to be
`s*gamma((c.α+2)/2)/sqrt(gamma((c.α+1)/2)*(gamma((c.α+3)/2)-gamma((c.α+2)/2)))`

    wavelet(c[, t=WT.Filter][, boundary=WT.Periodic][, s=Real])

Construct wavelet type where `c` is a wavelet class,
`t` is the transformation type (`WT.Filter` or `WT.Lifting`),
and `boundary` is the type of boundary treatment. In the continuous case, s>0
is the number of wavelets between the octaves ``2^J`` and ``2^{J+1}``
(defaults to 8, which is most appropriate for music and other audio).
