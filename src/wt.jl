# WAVELET CLASSES

@doc """
The `WaveletClass` type has subtypes `OrthoWaveletClass`
and `BiOrthoWaveletClass`.

The `WT` module has for convenience constants defined named
as the class short name and optionally amended with a number
specifing the number of vanishing moments.

A class can also be explicitly constructed as e.g. `Daubechies{4}()`.

**Example**: `WT.db2`, `WT.haar`, `WT.cdf97`
